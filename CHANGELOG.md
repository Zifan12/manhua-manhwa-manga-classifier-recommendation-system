# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [v0.1] — 2025-08-11
**Summary:** First working version of the manhua/manhwa/manga classifier. This is done upon completion of fast.ai first lesson and I wanted to make a tiny project to better understand the concepts. This first version only classify whether the image is a manga, manhwa, or manhua. 

### Added
- Initial Jupyter notebook with base classifier.
- Preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, normalization).
- Initial dataset labeling.

### Known Limitations
- Small dataset size → possible overfitting.
- Dataset not cleaned for duplicates. 
- Accuracy is low for manhwa vs manhua differentiation.
- Model training time is quite high consider this is not a large model.
